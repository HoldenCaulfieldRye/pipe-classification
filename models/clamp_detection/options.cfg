# batching script takes labels based on dirname. so need a dir of raw
# data for each classification task. inside such a dir, need subdirs
# for each label.
# then, need an output path for the batches. the batches contain the
# labels, so if these batches only contain clamp labels, will need
# different batch sets for each task. that's inefficient. when you
# come back to this, need to redo batching, with a dict of labels, each
# key corresponds to a different task, and during training, can specify
# which labels are used to train.
