skynet layers-imagenet.cfg with zero learning rate
set test-freq in options.cfg to maximum, so that the same test set is used every time
to get max test-range, need test-many == -1 and test-one false
changing test-freq to 10, all I want to do is test that the training is working properly. with 0 learning rate, should get identical error
good, I did get identical error
now let's try tiny to normal learning rates
