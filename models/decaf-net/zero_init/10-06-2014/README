Krizhevsky/skynet/decaf config, with even smaller learning rate, and smaller momentum
train error converged before overfit. let's get momentum back up to 0.9 like skynet, and nothing else
(momentum used to be at 0.5 on conv1-fc6, 0.9 for the other 2)
changed momentum at 40.690
also changed test-range from 871-886 to 851-886
