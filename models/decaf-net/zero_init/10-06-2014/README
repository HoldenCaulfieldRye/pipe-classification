Krizhevsky/skynet/decaf config, with even smaller learning rate, and smaller momentum
train error converged before overfit. let's get momentum back up to 0.9 like skynet, and nothing else
(momentum used to be at 0.5 on conv1-fc6, 0.9 for the other 2)
changed momentum at 40.690
also changed test-range from 871-886 to 851-886
increasing momentum worsened validation error. bringing it to zero now, in case it's overshooting the minimum. not changing learning rate yet
this momentum set-to-zero takes effect from 48.35
CAREFUL with the epoch.batchnum values, when you restart training, they don't start where you left off, but where weights were last saved
